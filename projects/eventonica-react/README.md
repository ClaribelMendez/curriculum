# Intro to Eventonica

Welcome to the Eventonica project!

In this project, you'll make a web app to manage events.

You'll work on this project over the next several weeks. The features will remain the same but as you learn more libraries and techniques, you'll integrate those into the app. By the end you'll have built a full-stack web app with React and a database.

## Project Requirements

  - The attributes are up to you. Look through all the features and see what an Event needs
- Delete an Event

### Search Events

### Favorite Events

- A User can **favorite** an Event
